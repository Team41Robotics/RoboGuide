We use these as complex touch inputs that we customize for the game each year. Everything is programmed in Python 3, and the file is automatically run py the Zeroes when they boot up. Python is another programming language, and it is very different from C++ and Java. This is not a tutorial for Python, but an excellent one can be found"," ",o.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp"},"here"),". ",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"We use a few Python modules to code the Zeroes on the driver station. First, we use the Tkinter module to take touch input and display images on the screen. The Tkinter module is made for displaying graphics with Python. We only imported Tk, Canvas, CENTER, RIGHT, LEFT, and N from the modules.To initialize Tkinter, create a new variable with the value of"," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"Tk()"),". This variable represents the entire Tkinter window, and various settings can be changed on it, but I'm not going to cover all of them. The most important methods are ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"geometry"),","," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"bind"),", and"," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"focus_set"),". Geometry is used to set the size and position of the window, and the exact argument to enter is described in detail"," ",o.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-geometry-method-in-tkinter/"},"here"),". The ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"bind()")," method binds a key to a Tkinter function. We used it to tell Tkinter to quit every time the escape key was pressed (",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},'root.bind("',"<","Escape",">",'" ,lambda e: root.quit())'),". Finally, ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"focus_set")," makes sure that the window is on top and nothing is covering it.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"To start Tkinter, put"," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"root.mainloop()")," at the end of your file. This runs everything in a loop, so that everything can update. What we also do its put"," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"root.after(delay, publish)")," right before that line. Firstly, this sets the refresh rate, and secondly it runs a function every time it refreshes. In our publish function, we check to see if any button have been clicked, and if so we send that information to the Due (more on that later).",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"The most important part of Tkinter, though, is the canvas. The canvas is where everything is drawn on the screen, and where most of the code is. To create a canvas, use"," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"Canvas(","<","name of Tk() variable",">",", width=","<","width",">",", height=","<","height",">",", background=","<","bg color",">"),". I recommend setting height and width as variables, because they will be used again. Additionally, set the Canvas as a variable, because it is needed to draw everything (here, it will be represented as ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"ctx"),"). On the canvas, you can do one of three things: create text, create a shape, or show an image. Additionally,"," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"ctx.pack()")," needs to be somewhere in your file before",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"root.mainloop()"),". This is what actually draws everything on the screen.",o.a.createElement("br",null),"To create text, use"," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"ctx.create_text(","<","x",">",", ","<","y",">",")"),", where x and y is the position of the button. There are also several optional arguments, all of which can be viewed"," ",o.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/create_text.html"},"here"),".",o.a.createElement("br",null),"Another use of the canvas is to create shapes. We only use the rectangle on the driver station, and it is the most simple. To make a rectangle, call",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"ctx.creat_rect(","<","x0",">",", ","<","y0",">",", ","<","x1",">",", ","<","y1",">",")"),". Here x0 and y0 represent the top left corner, and x1 and y1 represent the bottom right corner.

",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"The third main canvas object is an image. We mainly use this as background, but with enough effort, we could make the whole interface with custom images. To create an image on the canvas, use"," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"ctx.create_image(","<","x",">",", ","<","y",">",", image=","<","image_var",">",")"),". Here, image_var is an ImageTk object. Importing an image is somewhat simple. To do so, import Image and ImageTk from the PIL module. Then create a variable with"," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"Image.open(","<","full_path_to_image",">",")"),". We'll call this variable ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"bg"),". Then, set that variable to"," ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"ImageTk.PhotoImage(bg)"),". This just replaces the Image object with an ImageTk object that we can use on the canvas.",o.a.createElement("br",null),"Finally, we need to know if a button has been clicked. In the code, I made a button class that handled everything for the button, but basically, we can use",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},"root.bind()")," to call a function every time the left mouse button is pressed (",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},'ctx.bind("',"<","Button-1",">",'", handle_click)'),"). Tkinter passed that function an object that has the x and y position of the click. Since the buttons are squares, we can just check if the click was within both the x and y boundaries of the button.",o.a.createElement("br",null),o.a.createElement("br",null),"That is everything for Tkinter, and a basic program that does everything I talked about would look something like this:",o.a.createElement(w.a,{titleClass:"d-none",gist:"MasonDiGi/389e465ccb900c75c1b4a455ac84865d"}),o.a.createElement("br",null),"The second main module we use in the driver station code is Pyserial. This is what communicates with the Due to send the inputs from Tkinter.

The port is different depending on the device, but on the Raspberry Pi it is ",o.a.createElement("span",{className:"code"},'"/dev/ttyAMA0"'),". The rate is the same rate that we set on the Due when that was programmed. Pyserial is a complicated module, but for our purposes it only has one more function that we care about.
