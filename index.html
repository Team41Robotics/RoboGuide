					<h1 class="text-center">Java Basics</h1>
					On team 41 we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented programming language</a>.
					What this means is that our programs are based around the creation and use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)">objects</a>.
					These objects have properties which are associated with them.
					This allows us easily reference our data.
					For example, take a look at this simple Bird class:
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/JamesNarayanan/6f49b41bc5e75cc5071ffdd418e8d45e.js"></script>
					In Java, a class is an object that can be manipulated.
					In this case, the Bird object has attrributes that store its color, name, and position.
					It also has built in functions that manipulate its properties or return values about it.
					One advantage to creating an object such as this is that other users can use it without knowing exactly how it works.
					This principle is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)">abstraction</a> and is very useful when writing programs.
					It allows people to easily build off pre-existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">libraries</a> (collections of programs).
					<br><br>
					Before we go too far though, let's take a step back and start with some of the fundamentals of programming languages.
					<br><br><br>
					<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)">Comments</a></h2>
						Before we start going over code, knowing what a comment is will be helpful.
						<script src="https://gist.github.com/JamesNarayanan/aada7a81ccd9220bf791cffd3916a0d5.js"></script>
					<br><br>
					<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)">Variables</a></h2>
						One of the most important parts of any programming language is the use of variables.
						These are named values stored in the computer's RAM.
						In Java, the primitive <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html">variable types</a> include the following:
						<ul>
							<li><span class="code">boolean</span> true or false (1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a>)</li>
							<li><span class="code">byte</span> Stores whole number values from -128 to 127 (8-bit)</li>
							<li><span class="code">short</span> Stores whole number values from −32,768 to 32,767 (16-bit)</li>
							<li><span class="code">char</span> Stores character values from '\u0000' (0) to '\uffff' (65535) (16-bit). This is a way to store a <u>single</u> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> character.</li>
							<li><span class="code">int</span> Stores whole number values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (32-bit).
								If one tries to store a number with a decimal point in an int (or any other data type that cannot store floating point values), the compiler will throw an error.</li>
							<li><span class="code">long</span> Stores whole number values from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808‬ to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (64-bit).</li>
							<li><span class="code">float</span> Stores 32-bit <a href="https://floating-point-gui.de/formats/fp/">floating point</a> values (can have a decimal point)</li>
							<li><span class="code">double</span> Stores 64-bit floating point values (can have a decimal point)</li>
						</ul>
						Another very commonly used data type in Java is a <span class="code">String</span>.
						This type of variable is used to represent a <i>String</i> of character connected together.
						We use it to represent any collection of characters, including single characters, words, or sentences.
						<br>
						Also, it is a Java convention to declare variables using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">camel case</a>.

					<br><br>
					<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine">Functions</a></h2>
						The use of functions allows a programmer to organize their code effectively as well as reduce repition.
						Functions are sometimes also referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">methods</a>.
						Just like in mathematics, a function in Java has inputs (paramaters) and returns a value
						based on those inputs. In math you've probably seen a function written like this:
						<img src="images/mathFunction.png" class="d-block mx-auto my-1 p-2 rounded monokai" style="height: 50px;">
						This same function could be written in Java as:
						<img src="images/functionEx1.svg" class="d-block mx-auto my-1">
						A function in java has a few main components that make it up:
						<ul>
							<li>Return Type - This includes all the primitive types talked about above,
								as well as any type of Object, or void (does not return anything)</li>
							<li>Name - Typically written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">camel case</a>, like variables</li>
							<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)">Parameters</a> - These are the inputs for the function. Each one must have its type specified.
								Functions can also be constructed without any parameters</li>
							<li>Curly Braces - Not optional</li>
							<li>Code to Execute - If the function has a return type (not void), then it MUST have a return statement in it.</li>
						</ul>
						Here is a function that I made when I created a TicTacToe game in Java:
						<img src="images/functionEx2.svg" class="d-block mx-auto my-1">
						This function checks if the TicTacToe board is full by iterating through each row and column.
						This is useful because now I can use this elsewhere in the code. When somebody reads my code, they will see:
						<img src="images/functionEx2Call.svg" class="d-block mx-auto my-1">
						They will quickly be able to understand what I'm trying to do (and the function annotation will clear up any questions).
						Functions go a long way towards making code neater.

						<br><br>
						<h4>Scope</h4>
							Functions must placed inside a class. There are two main scopes that functions are declared with: public and private.
							Public functions can be accessed by any instance of the function's respective class object.
							Private functions can only be accessed within the specific class. This is useful for when a function is only used for some internal computation in the class.
							This will be shown further in the next section about classes.
					
					<br><br><br>
					<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)">Classes</a></h2>
						Classes are essential components of programs in object oriented languages.
						An object in Java is created as a class. As mentioned in the beginning of the guide,
						a class can have multiple variables and methods associated with it.

					<h1 class="text-center">Software Setup</h1>
					<h2><a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Install Java</a></h2>
						Press download to go to the downloads page for your respectice operating system.
						There may be multiple versions. You should use the version that is recommended.
					<br><br>
					<h2><a href="https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html">Install WPILib & VS Code</a></h2>
						Since the 2018-2019 season, we write our programming using Visual Studio Code.
						It is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that uses a plugin called WPILib.
						WPILib contains tons of classes that are the foundation of any FRC robot project.
						If you want detailed documentation about WPILib classes, go <a href="https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/index.html">here</a>.
					<br><br>
					<h2><a href="https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/frc-game-tools.html">Install FRC Game Tools</a></h2>
						The part of the game tools that we use most often is the <a href="https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station.html">driver station</a>.
						We use it to run our code as well as other things including checking the comms status, checking the battery voltage, and finding game controller ports.
						When installing the game tools, you may be asked for some identification. Ask your captain about that.
					<hr class="bg-white w-75">
					All done! Now you can finally get programming. To make your first project, open VS Code,
					click the WPILib icon in the top right, and click "Create New Project".
					If you want to start fresh, choose template -> java -> Timed Robot.
					If you to get a feel for program layout, you can choose to see an example project instead.
					(I recommend choosing the "Tank Drive" example. We've used Tank Drive to control the robot the past few years.)
